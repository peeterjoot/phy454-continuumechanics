\section{Stress tensor in 3D}

In 3D we have three components of the stress tensor acting on each surface, as illustrated in \cref{fig:continuumL4:continuumL4fig5}
\imageFigure{../../figures/phy454/lec4_Strain_components_on_a_3D_volumeFig5}{Strain components on a 3D volume}{fig:continuumL4:continuumL4fig5}{0.4}

We have three unique surface orientations and three components of the force for each of these, resulting in nine components, but these are not all independent.  For an object in equilibrium we must have \(\sigma_{ij} = \sigma_{ji}\).
\FIXME{justify?}
Explicitly, that is

\begin{align}\label{eqn:continuumL4:110}
\sigma_{12} &= \sigma_{21} \\
\sigma_{23} &= \sigma_{32} \\
\sigma_{31} &= \sigma_{13}
\end{align}
