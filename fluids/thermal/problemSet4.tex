\makeoproblem{Critical temperature}{problemset4:t}
{2012 problem set 4}
{
If \(R_c = \frac{27 \pi^4}{4}\) is the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection for water, what is the corresponding critical temperature difference between the top and bottom plates in a \(10 \text{cm}\) layer of fluid?

\makeoproblem{Critical wavelength}{problemset4:wavelen}
{2012 problem set 4}
{
What is the dimensional value of the critical wavelength of the convection cells?

\makeoproblem{Rigid plates}{problemset4:rigid}
{2012 problem set 4}
{
If instead of taking stress free boundary conditions at the top and bottom plates, if we consider both the plates 'rigid' (no-slip) how does the solution of \eqnref{eqn:continuumL22:970} change?
} % makeoproblem

\makeoproblem{Normal mode solutions}{problemset4:normal}
{2012 problem set 4}
{
Consider the problem

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:problemSet4:10}
\PD{t}{u} - \sin u = \inv{R} \PDSq{y}{u}
\end{equation}

where \(R\) is a real parameter and the boundary conditions are given by

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:problemSet4:20}
u(y = 0, t) = u(y = \pi, t) = 0
\end{equation}

for all time \(t\). Examine the trivial base state \(u = u_B(y) = 0\) by seeking normal mode solutions to the linearized perturbed equations. Find the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and show that the base state is linearly stable only if \(R \le 1\).
