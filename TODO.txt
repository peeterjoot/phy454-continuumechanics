   - change mathematica hyperlinks to internal links.

   - traction vector in chapter 3 is T, but \tau in later chapters.  Changed to \tau.  Also see the use of \BP (ex 3.3) ?
      changed more t_, \Bt_ references to \tau_, \Btau_ ... this causes trouble in couetteflow.tex since tau is (rightly)
      use for torque there.  Probably ought to switch to all lower case t instead of tau (since t_i and \Bt won't be 
      confused with t for time, this may be a good choice).

      introduce newcommand's for the t_i in case it is desirable to change this once more.

   - Computational work:
   - attempt the problem to derive the compatibility condition.  Doing this should help resolve the issue of how the stress tensor can be applied.
   - coffee problem

   - As in phy487, introduce the use of mathImageFigure to couple generated
     figures to their notebooks.

   - may not have updated the web version for a while.  Don't see \nbref's in
     the current online version.

   - Indexing:
      ( http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing )

      -- got the make rules done (standalone sample: ../latex/index.tex).
      -- now have to add all the index tags.  Grabbed all my wordpress keywords and saved them to: indexTags.txt.  Do a search for those expressions
         and add \index{} entries, perhaps automatically to start with (i.e. first reference).

         -> This is now done for just the section headers, providing a
rudimentary index.  Would still be good to search for the indexTags.txt stuff
(pruning out section references) and see what's left to index.

For grep output from that indexTags file, I pruned out references to:

     %s/\\textAndIndex{[^}]\+}//
     %s/%.*//
     %s/.begin{equation.*//
     %s/.begin{dmath.*//
     %s/.pdfTexFigure.*//
     %s/.imageFigure{.*//
     %s/.label{.*//

      - Exercises:
      - not entirely pleased with how the exercise environment ends up looking.  Could end up rewriting that using the latex templates sample.
      - put links back to questions in the answers.
      - Can add paragraph headings to give titles to sub-Question answers.
         - had done that (\unnumberedSubsection command), but was seeing weird effects with section titles emitted later after the environment closed ... like before the text in the summary sections).  backed all that out for now and replaced with plain old text.
      - \ref{} markers for multi-part questions aren't showing up well.  Looks like mis-interaction with \paragraph{}.  Probably do something more systematic, labeling these references with
         Question #: Text

   - Visual:
      - graphical cover page (stirred cup of coffee;) would be nice.

   - Figures:
      - go through all figures and re-draw many.
      - can open with Sketchbook express, and then turn the initial drawing into a hidden layer, tracing the original.

   - Computational work:
      - attempt the extra optional homework from handouts/ClassNote17.pdf

   - Latex:
      - would be nice to have the bib and index show up as parts directly without having to have chapter headings in the parts (like the preface and contents).
         One solution would be to flatten the chapters and then remove the parts.  Especially now that I've got most of my worked problems moved into Q/A environments (to be moved along with the relevant material).

      (phy485 looks better in this respect)

      - Make \FIXME conditional on classicthesis drafting variable.
         (or switch to \fixme package as done in phy485 notes).
