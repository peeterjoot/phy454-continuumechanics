- reorganization: inserted Das's name for textbook rework starting point.  Accidentally merged that into master, and undid it in:

      https://github.com/peeterjoot/physicsplay/commit/d1fd25d694335da181f1d5054094bdfacafdf1d5

      now switching to 454text branch doesn't work (? :... Can do on lagrangian).
      On checkout of 454text see the Das name changes there, but github shows the branch merged.  If that project goes anywhere may have to redo from the diff above (or the email to Das).  

- Das would like his name in the notes so that he can show it to the publisher.

- Latex:
   - try to figure out how to show the filenames in drafting mode.  currfile package has a mechanism for this, and it also works with scrreprt class.  but doesn't work with classicthesis?
      - have ../th/ (no source control to try out simple standalone experiments with this template)
      - looks like this is done with scrpage2

- how to format a chapter without a whole page used for the title of the chapter.
		This was due to use of \chapter followed by \include.  Switched to input instead.  won't matter when \chapter is embedded in the chapter text.
- switch to the memoir class has made the text more paper-book-like, with margins switching sides (and smaller I think) on even and odd pages.  Figure out how to undo that so that the book is more uniform for online reading.

-- Would be nice to format the part's like the chapter style though.  Saw one example on tex stackexchange how to do so, but not for my chapter style.

- second chapter heading spacing (strain) is all messed up.   but no others?
  - try standalone repro to isolate.

- took out the \part's but probably want them back to at least separate the lecture notes from the worked problems.  


- don't like the centering of the Exercise environment.  See about adjusting that to remove the centering.

- (non-ugly) title page would be nice.

- looks like I got my Exercise headings left justified like I wanted, but there's no space between the number and the title text.

- okay, put back two parts, but things are still a bit messed up.  have the appendix and bib stuck in the second part for example.  Add unnamed part?  ... had to put the appendices and bib in their own parts.  Good enough.

- have left the two exploratory worked problems at the end in a 'worked problem' section. ... delete these? (OR COMPLETE).  Moved to an appendix for now.

- Should probably abstract away all my current dependencies on memoir and create my own style
  so that I can switch styles if desired.

- the thesis_2 from http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com, is really nice.  requires non-commercial, so I couldn't sell the book
  if using it (as is).  Continue abstracting away my style dependencies.

- rework problem sets, midterm reflection, and portions of the review notes using the exercise class.  probably emit the solutions at the end of the elasticity and fluids sections respectively.  have grouped some of this now in the fluids section.  change to exercise style, then 


- appendix dummy page doens't have consistent style.  probably want the part style that I've now discarded.  would be kind of nice to have the appendixes all under this appendix page in a more hierarchical way.
   - fixed with classicthesis sty .. but still have the oddity of having the bib and index in the appendix part.

- Dig up old elastics summary text and add that back into the first couple chapters like I did in the elastodynamics (and later in fluids).

- acrobat starts up on page 3 (what's the copyright page)?
  - perhaps this is why there was the dirty title page? -- fix: add back in the dirty title page from the template.

- add structure to the fluids chapters and review for redundancy.  Possible chapters:
   Fluid Dynamics
      - derive NS
      - no slip
      - boundary value conditions
   Steady State Navier Stokes
   Non-dimensionalisation
   Time dependent Navier Stokes
      - Boundary layers
   Ill conditioned differential equations
   Stability and thermal effects

- use 'EDITING NOTE' instead of FIXME as in:

   \paragraph{EDITING NOTE}

  (perhaps make command or environment for this that I could omit for non-draft mode).

- Exercises:
   - use a different color than blue.  Makes it look like a link.

- think I had color in my section, subsection headers with the memoir based style.  Liked that.  How to do this with the classicthesis style?

- too long titles for many.  Capitalize first word in all these titles.  Curve for tap: requires description.

- problem sets, midterm and other problems: later move to more appropriate sections once those are created (like the strain and stress chapters).

- chapter and section headings.
   be more consistent with style.  Capitialize first word

- chapter, section, caption, ... headings.
   be more consistent with style: no ending periods.

   fix:
     grep -l '\. *}' `cat t` | tee l
     perl -p -i -e 's/\. *}/}/g' `cat l`

- had commented out some of my section/subsection headers in my worked problems.  Convert those to paragraph headings.

- add stubs for problems in the elasticity section.  note that 3d compatibility was supposed to have had homework.

- Exercises:
   - want chapter numbers in my exercises.

         3.4 The nrenewcounter command
         In a document, you will probably want to customise the way the Exercise counter
         will reseted. Strangely, it is impossible to redened counter with LATEX. There is
         no equivalent of the \renewcommand command for the counters.
         \renewcounter We provide such an equivalent with the command \renewcounter.

- implement an example environment, like that of Exercise.
   uses:
      boundary layer flow: 1) recilinear 2) oscillatory.

- section headers that match the chapter headings should go.

- have FIXME's in some of the non-tex files too.  grep for these and prioritize or handle.

- latex
   - found breqn package with its dmath and auto-long-equation line splitting feature!  asking on tex forum for how to maintain my color selections.  note that dmath has some color options
     for both background and text, which could be nicer than \boxed{}.
     - this is a touchy package.  can't compile my doc even without converting anything to dmath.  Saved experimental changes in dmath.patch (including some hacks).
     - also code in fluids/thermal/stability.tex marked with breqn, but my alternate version didn't work.  Need dseries?
   - with the switch to packages, should I change the way that I'm doing peeters_macros.tex to a .sty command.  If so where 
   should I put them.  Running texhash (admin cmd window) created for me:
   /cygdrive/c/Users/Peeter/AppData/Local/MiKTeX/2.9

      C:\Windows\system32>texhash
      Creating fndb for user root directory (C:\Users\Peeter\AppData\Roaming\MiKTeX\2.9)...
      Creating fndb for user root directory (C:\Users\Peeter\AppData\Local\MiKTeX\2.9)
      ...
      Skipping common root directory (C:\ProgramData\MiKTeX\2.9)...
      Skipping common root directory ("C:\Program Files (x86)\MiKTeX 2.9")...

   but don't know where to put stuff in there.

   Also, looking at Joseph's answer I tried:

      Windows Vista/7 C:\Users\<user name>\texmf\tex\latex\local\

   but this didn't work for me.

   had (and deleted the following symlinks that pointed to those spots).

      lrwxrwxrwx  1 Peeter None      49 May 18 10:21 local2 -> /cygdrive/c/Users/Peeter/AppData/Local/MiKTeX/2.9
      lrwxrwxrwx  1 Peeter None      46 May 17 23:21 localdir -> /cygdrive/c/Users/Peeter/texmf/tex/latex/local
      
- color
   - for chapter title text.
   - for Definition environment.
   - use different colors for numbers and titles in sections.
   - fix colors for Exercise (below)
   - change figure color: DarkOliveGreen for number.  Black for Figure text.  Maroon (?) for figure text?

- Basic Editing:
   - add some structure to the fluids chapters.  There will be a lot of redundancy to remove there too.
   - flatten the layout of a lot of the chapters, removing sections and subsections and so forth.
   - stress chapter could use a lot of rework, but some of the redundancy is gone.  Cleaning up and removing some of the figures would help.
   - spell check everything.

- Figures:
   - go through all figures and make sure they are good sizes.  many too small.  Re-draw many.
   - add figure labels into the captions as a debug mode to easily find these in the text.
      - don't bother: using pdf viewer to do the lookup is far superior!
   - In inclinedFlowWithoutConstantHeightAssumption: figure: Differential vector element ... MIA?
   - Noticed some other figures with captions but figure MIA.

- Ack.
   - Dedication page to kids.
   - Ack to Prof.

- FIXME's:
   - review all the \FIXME use in the .tex files.  If anything worth keeping do so.  Otherwise introduce draft mode and hide this by default.
   - all fixme's now suppressed.  FIXME macro also didn't appear to be working properly (since adding color via unnumberedSubsection?)

- License and copyright
   - switch to a CC license?  probably want non-commercial attribution no-modification to retain maximal rights.
   - add back copyright statements in all .tex files.
