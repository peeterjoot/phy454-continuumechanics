This book is based on my lecture notes for the Winter 2012, University of Toronto Continuum Mechanics course (PHY454H1S), taught by Prof. Kausik S. Das.

That course covered the fundamentals of fluid dynamics in a sensible and logical fashion, providing a great base for further learning.

Official course description:

The theory of continuous matter, including solid and fluid mechanics.  Topics include the continuum approximation, dimensional analysis, stress, strain, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, vorticity, waves, instabilities, convection and turbulence.

What you will find in this book:

- My lecture notes.
- Problem sets and midterm solutions. These have been incorporated into the lecture material as chapter end problems with solutions.
- Some worked problems attempted for fun or for exam preparation.
- Links to Mathematica workbooks associated with course content.
